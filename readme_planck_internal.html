<h2>Planck Cosmomc Readme </h2>
<h3>Compiling</h3>
Set <b>highL = ../highL</b> to build direct ACT/SPT support (for use with PLANCKLIKE = cliklike_CamSpec). You can either use clik or other likelihoods directly in an interchangeable way, parameter definitions etc are the same.
<p>
<h3>Data files</h3>
A set of .ini files are supplied in ./batch2 which set up standard for Planck full mission runs. Location of data files is set in CAMspec_ACTSPT_defaults, CAMspec_defaults depending on what you want to use. You can either edit these, or make symbolic links from ./data/clik to the relevant actual file locations depending on what you want to use (and ./data/highL and ./data/camspec if you want to run them outside clik).

<UL>
<LI><b>master</b> is the latest tested stable version; CAMB updated since 2013 first grid results
<LI><b>final_nominal</b> is the code used for 2013 first papers
<LI><b>final_nominal_updated</b> is above with various bug fixes, using CAMB March 2013b as original papers
<LI><b>cosmomc_public</b> is the current public version
<LI><b>camspec_wiggle</b> has some camspec likelihood variations etc used for tests
<LI><b>tmp_cl_dump</b> has hack to dump C_l when postprocessing (for rainbow plots)

<H3>Changes since public nominal mission release</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Support for derived parameters from each likelihood function
<LI>Support for best-fit data output for each likelihood
<LI>CamSpec refactored; foreground model .camspec_foreground file output along with .bestfit_cl
<LI>CamSpec derived parameters (total foreground amplitudes at L=2000)
<LI>added camspec_make.ini for making beam-marged; use of .bestfit_cl and .camspec_foreground for fiducial model
<LI>removed _marge_mode marged like file (can easily be calculated on the fly)
<LI>Click 8.8 has new highL file actspt_2013_11.clik
<LI>widened values cosmology parameter priors; Added batch2/HST* files for different Hubble contraints

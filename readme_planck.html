<h2>CosmoMC and GetDist with Planck Likelihood and Chains</h2>
The Planck likelihood code (PLC/clik) and parameter chains are available from the PLA.
<P>
<H3>Using the Planck likelihood with CosmoMC</H3>
Here I assume you have installed CosmoMC in a directory called COSMOMC..PATH, and the plc in a directory called PLC..PATH.
Note you need to use ifort 13 or higher to build CosmoMC, so make sure you have that configured before you start.
<UL>
<LI>Download and extract the plc_1.0 directories somewhere convenient, probably not under cosmomc.
<LI>Change to the plc_1.0  directory and do 
<pre>bzip2 -d plc-1.0.tar.bz2; tar -xf plc-1.0.tar</pre>
<LI><pre>cd plc-1.0</pre>
<LI><pre>./waf configure --lapack_mkl=${MKLROOT} --lapack_mkl_version=10.3 --install_all_deps</pre>
  (you may need to change the options on this line depending on your installation; --install_all_deps may not be needed)
<LI><pre>./waf install</pre>
<LI>Edit your ~/.bashrc file to include
<pre>
export PLANCKLIKE=cliklike
export CLIKPATH=PLC..PATH/plc_1.0/plc_1.0
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CLIKPATH/lib
</pre>
While you're add it you can add CosmoMC's python plotting path
<pre>
export PYTHONPATH=COSMOMC..PATH/python:$PYTHONPATH
</pre>
<LI>Change to your COSMOMC..PATH root directory and make a symbolic link to your PLC installation
<pre>
ln -s PLC..PATH/plc_1.0 ./data/clik
</pre>
(CosmoMC will look for files in ./data/clik).
<LI>Log out and in again to get the new settings,  then you can build cosmomc as described in the <A HREF="readme.html">ReadMe</A>.
</UL>

<h3>CosmoMC settings</h3>
A set of .ini files are supplied in ./planck1 which set up standards for Planck runs. Location of data files is set in CAMspec_ACTSPT_defaults, CAMspec_defaults depending on what you want to use.
You can either edit these, or make symbolic links from ./data/clik to the relevant actual file locations depending on what you want to use
<P>
Settings for the Planck parameter grid are in python/settings_planck_nominal.py.

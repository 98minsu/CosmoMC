\begin{abstract}
These tables summarize the results of \textit{Planck} parameter estimation exploration results. They include Planck data in combination with WMAP polarization, \textit{Planck} lensing, and high-$l$ CMB experiments, as well as additional non-CMB data as detailed in the main parameter papers.

\section*{Introduction}

The tables are arranged grouped firstly by cosmological model, and then by data combination. The name tags match those of the full chains also provided on the PLA. They all start with {\tt base} to denote the baseline model, followed by the parameter tags of any additional parameters that are also varied (as defined in the parameter paper). Data combination tags are as follows (see the parameters paper for full description and references):

\begin{tabular} { l   l  }
Data tag & Data used\\
\hline
${\tt CamSpec}$ & high-$l$ Planck temperature ($50\le l\le 2500$) \\
{\tt lowl }          & low-$l$ Planck temperature ($2\le l \le 49$)  \\
{\tt lowLike}        & low-$l$ WMAP polarization \\
{\tt tauprior}       & A Gaussian prior on the optical depth, $\tau = 0.09 \pm 0.013$
{\tt lensing}        & Planck lensing power spectrum reconstruction \\
{\tt BAO}            & Baryon oscillation data from DR7, DR9 and and 6DF \\
{\tt SNLS}           & Supernova data from the Supernova Legacy Survey \\
{\tt Union2}         & Supernova data from the Union compilation \\
{\tt HST}            & Hubble parameter constraint from HST (Riess et al) \\
{\tt WMAP}           & WMAP 9 year data \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Data combinations are either included when running the chains, or by importance sampling. Data combinations that are added by importance sampling appear 
at the end of the list, following the {\tt post{\textunderscore}} tag. WMAP9 chains are run from the WMAP9 likelihood code with the same baseline assumptions as \textit{Planck}, and hence
may different slightly from those available on Lambda (e.g. the baseline model has non-zero neutrino mass).

Full parameter chains are available separate from the PLA.
